# Governance Protocol

## On-chain governance:

Vote on AAIPs via the voting portal on our dedicated armada DAO website for governance. The idea is the user logs into their armada user accounts using the Nami wallet feature developed by BERRY pool. The governance site will be a DApp that will connect to Nami via its DApp connector to allow for a smart contract-based voting system like in AAVE and Maker DAO where the user essentially “locks” up their governance tokens on the various Polls or AAIPs for an epoch until voting ends.

Currently the two main on-chain governance mechanisms are:
	1) Polls - where the user votes on a specific AAIP or AAIPs that do not change or alter the codebase of the Armada Alliance website, tutorials, or DAO. These AAIPs fall under the category of “Standard" or "Informational". The Polls are simple and will be on-chain but will be in the form of a smart contract and apply a simple majority rule to determine the outcome of the Polls.
	2) Voting - only proposals made in the intention of changing the codebase of the Armada Alliance website, tutorials, or DAO there is a need to have a more stringent protcol for voting. We will discuss how the voting system will be implemented in the future.

## Off-chain governance:

The Armada DAO’s off-chain governance model will consist of feedback from the community which will help aid quality assurance, open dialogue, and will be the breeding ground for new ideas or improvements.

The off-chain governance will need to have ways of participating in the improvements to the Armada Alliance’s services, management, and governance. There are various types of “improvement proposals” that we refer to as Armada Alliance Improvement Proposals. In “AAIP1: The AAIP Process”, we have outlined the required process along with categorization of improvement proposals if you would like to learn more.&#x20;

The off-chain governance model will assist in making sure new ideas can form and grow to become AAIPs that can be submitted to the next stage known as risk assessment or risk analysis (this step may be omitted based on the criteria the proposed improvement may lie in).&#x20;

After risk analysis has been conducted there will be an “on-chain” voting mechanism that we will discuss in another article, once the votes are tallied we will post the results to the community forum, then implement them via a smart contract.
