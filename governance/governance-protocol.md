# Governance Protocol

## On-chain governance

Vote on AAIPs via the voting portal, the methodology is still being researched and more research to be done on how to use “on-chain” voting or even smart contracts.

## Off-chain governance:

The Armada DAO’s off-chain governance model will consist of feedback from the community which will help aid quality assurance, open dialogue, and will be the breeding ground for new ideas or improvements.

The off-chain governance will need to have ways of participating in the improvements to the Armada Alliance’s services, management, and governance. There are various types of “improvement proposals” that we refer to as Armada Alliance Improvement Proposals. In “AAIP1: The AAIP Process”, we have outlined the required process along with categorization of improvement proposals if you would like to learn more.&#x20;

The off-chain governance model will assist in making sure new ideas can form and grow to become AAIPs that can be submitted to the next stage known as risk assessment or risk analysis (this step may be omitted based on the criteria the proposed improvement may lie in).&#x20;

After risk analysis has been conducted there will be an “on-chain” voting mechanism that we will discuss in another article, once the votes are tallied we will post the results to the community forum, then implement them via a smart contract.
